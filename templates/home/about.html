  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a creative digital designer based in the UK, combining
    <strong>branding, photography, video and digital content</strong>
    to help individuals, small businesses and creators present themselves
    professionally online.
  </p>

  <p>
    My background in software development and digital design has allowed me to
    work across a wide range of creative projects — from building small web
    projects to producing visual content for branding, events and online media.
    I take a practical, hands-on approach, focusing on clean visuals, clear
    communication and results that feel authentic to each client.
  </p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Logo design and brand identity</li>
    <li>Event and on-location photography</li>
    <li>Photo and video editing for social content</li>
    <li>3D logo animation and motion experiments</li>
    <li>Digital and web-based creative projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My approach</h2>
  <p>
    I like to keep projects straightforward and collaborative. I take time to
    understand the goal, audience and context, then build visuals that match
    the tone and direction of the brand. Every project — big or small — is
    treated with the same care and attention to detail.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools & Equipment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sony A7R V — photography and content capture</li>
    <li>DJI drone — aerial photography (where permitted)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro — editing and production workflow</li>
    <li>Industry-standard editing and design software</li>
  </ul>
